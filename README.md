**Age and Gender Detection with Deep Learning**

**ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**

This project leverages deep learning techniques to detect a person's age and gender from images. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for model training and predictions, along with a user-friendly Streamlit UI for interaction. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.


**ðŸš€ Features**

- Pretrained CNN model for accurate and efficient predictions.
- Image preprocessing to enhance input quality.
- Streamlit-based UI for an interactive user experience.
- Visualization of training and validation performance metrics.

**ðŸ“‚ Project Structure**

- app.py â†’ Streamlit app for user interaction.
- age_gender_identification.ipynb â†’ Script for model training and evaluation.
- requirements.txt â†’ List of project dependencies.
